        <h1>Rhetorics of Science, Technology + Culture</h1>
        <hr>
        <h2>Why RSTC?</h2>
        <p>The Rhetorics of Science, Technology, and Culture major prepares students to thrive in, and contribute to, our information-rich
            world. This major is built around concepts drawn from classical rhetoric — the systematic study and effective
            creation of texts for different audiences — but also includes courses examining modern phenomena like cutting-edge
            scientific communication, digital writing, and cross-cultural interactions. Students who choose this major are
            interested in learning how to:</p>
        <ul class="body">
            <li>Communicate clearly and effectively with a multiple audience</li>
            <li>Produce professional scientific and technical texts</li>
            <li>Enhance their critical thinking skills</li>
            <li>Ensure published information is ethical</li>
            <li>Explore the ways science, technology, and culture influence each other in a variety of contexts</li>
            <li>Understand the ways images and texts work together to create meaning</li>
            <li>Create documents that help people carry out tasks</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Along with learning more about how rhetoric shapes human interactions and how they can use rhetorical strategies
            in their own writing, RSTC students also learn how to interpret, synthesize, and produce research-based texts
            for different audiences and purposes.</p>
        <h1>Multimedia Communications</h1>
        <hr>
        <h2>A Minor for Our Times</h2>
        <p>The ability to develop ideas and present them through a variety of media is indispensable in our communication-rich
            society. The interdisciplinary minor in Multimedia Communication prepares students to analyze audiences, frame
            arguments, express themselves clearly in the written and spoken word, understand basic principles of visual design,
            gather and edit audio and video, and use web-based software to publish their work.</p>
        <p>Students take courses from the domains of visual communication (Art, Communication and Journalism), written communication
            (Communication and Journalism, English) and computer programing (Computer Science). The minor is suitable for
            students who would benefit from the ability to communicate information from their disciplines to a variety of
            audiences.
        </p>
        <p>Students must complete a total of 24 credits for the minor. Courses counted in the core cannot be used to fulfill
            requirements in elective credit domains. Because the minor is designed to broaden students' knowledge and skills
            in multimedia communication no more than nine credits in the prefix of a student's major may be counted toward
            the minor.</p>
        <p>The required core courses are Computer Graphics, Multimedia Communication, and Fundamentals of Web Page Design, one
            English course, and four additional electives selected from options in art, CJ, computer science, and English.</p>
